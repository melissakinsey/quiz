# Coding and Technical Writing Quiz

Simple quiz app composed in HTML/CSS and Javascript.

## Description

As our fourth homework assignment, we were asked to create a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions and a clean, polished, responsive user interface. The quiz runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It stores the users' scores so they can compare their progress to that of their peers.

## Credits

Credit is due to the following:
*Our fabulous Columbia University Boot Camp instructor, teaching assistants, and staff

*My tutor, Alyssa Schmalenberger

*Our amazing little "We Got This!" study group (#study-group-1")!

*Quiz adapted from a tutorial by Brian Design ![How to Build a Quiz in HTML CSS Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4fB9Xg2JEY)
_NOTE_: No code was copied and pasted from this tutorial. I've spent 10+ hours (so far) going through the tutorial and looking up anything I encountered that was new to me, such as the use of "vh" and "vw" dimensions and the ".splice" function in Javascript. I also scrapped the tutorial's buttons and instead used JQuery buttons. I used CSS to style the quiz differently, and I used a Google font ("Work Sans") to change the typeface.
*Some quiz questions adapted from ![Technical Writing Quiz III: API Documentation](https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/technical-writing-tests-for-screening-candidates/)
